        <p><b>Full-Stack Developer, Quirky Jewelry Collector, Foodie, Musical Junkie, Idle Writer, Card Player, INFJ</b>  </p> <br><br>

        <p>I am currently enrolled in Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp program and learning the fundamentals of full-stack web development. I am eager to continue learning and apply my previous experience and knowledge in a technical field.</p><br>

        <p>My background is in social science research and I have always been "data-oriented," however the driving force in my career has been helping improve the lives of people with neuro-developmental disabilities. For me, I believe fully accepting and realizing the strengths and talents of people with disabilities is crucial to accomplish this goal. I have interests in disability advocacy, research, and community engagement, and hope to use my newfound technical knowledge to make a larger impact toward these interests. </p><br><br>
